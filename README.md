# xv6: Modified Operating System and Labs

This project is a customized version of **xv6**, a re-implementation of UNIX Version 6 (v6) by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, adapted for modern RISC-V multiprocessor systems using ANSI C. The primary objective of this project is to modify the xv6 operating system and its associated labs, building upon the original educational foundation provided by MIT's 6.1810.

## Acknowledgments

This work is based on the original xv6 operating system developed by **Frans Kaashoek**, **Robert Morris**, and **Russ Cox**, inspired by John Lions’s "Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition" (Peer to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7). We acknowledge their contributions as well as those of numerous contributors who have enhanced xv6 over the years.

## Modifications
This repository includes several new scripts, which will be listed in this section soon.

## Building and Running the System

To build and run the modified xv6, you'll need:
A RISC-V "newlib" toolchain and **QEMU** compiled for `riscv64-softmmu` for running xv6 in a virtualized environment, available at [Tools Used](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2024/tools.html).

### Build Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd xv6
   ```

2. Ensure the necessary toolchain and QEMU are installed and added to your shell’s search path.

3. Compile and run xv6:
   ```bash
   make qemu
   ```
